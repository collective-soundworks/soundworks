## Create new application

```sh
npx @soundworks/create@latest
```

See the [getting started](https://soundworks.dev/tutorials/getting-started.html) page for a step by step guide.

## Manual Install

But if you are adventurous, you can also install `soundworks` manually:

npm install --save @soundworks/core
```
