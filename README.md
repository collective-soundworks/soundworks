## Documentation

## API

[http://collective-soundworks.github.io/soundworks/](http://collective-soundworks.github.io/soundworks/)

## Overview

`soundworks` follows a client / server architecture where the server is written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and clients can be either regular browser clients or Node.js clients running for example on a Raspberry Pi.

The core of the framework is very minimal and dedicated at handling:
  - Http(s) server and basic routing
  - WebSockets initialization
  - Processes initialization
  - Distributed state management

`soundworks` can be extended with plugins to reuse common logic such as audio file loading, clock synchronisation, etc. Each plugin leaves in a separate repo for better modularity and to simplify version management.

## Installation

_Note: most of the time you won't need to install `soundworks` manually, consider using the [application template](#application-template) instead._

```
npm install @soundworks/core
```

## Application Template

The simplest way to start a new `soundworks` application is using the application template:

## Credits

`soundworks` has been initiated by [Norbert Schnell](https://github.com/NorbertSchnell), [Sébastien Robaszkiewicz](https://github.com/i-Robi), and [Benjamin Matuszewski](https://github.com/b-ma) at the [ISMM](http://ismm.ircam.fr/) team at [Ircam - Centre Pompidou](http://www.ircam.fr/) in the framework of the [*CoSiMa*](http://cosima.ircam.fr/) research project supported by the [French National Research Agency (ANR)](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/).

Futher developments has been supported in the framework of:
- The [RAPID-MIX project](http://rapidmix.goldsmithsdigital.com/), funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program
- The Ircam project _BeCoMe_
- The _Constella(c)tions_ residency of the STARTS program of the European Commission.

Development is pursued, led by Benjamin Matuszewski, in the [Interaction Music Movement Team](https://www.stms-lab.fr/team/interaction-son-musique-mouvement/) from the Ircam's STMS-LAB.
